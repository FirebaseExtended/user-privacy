 * A PersistentStream is an abstract base class that represents a streaming RPC

 * for streaming RPCs, and adds several critical features for our clients:
 *
 *   - Exponential backoff on failure
 *   - Authentication via CredentialsProvider
 *   - Dispatching all callbacks into the shared worker queue
 *
 * Subclasses of PersistentStream implement serialization of models to and
 * from the JSON representation of the protocol buffers for a specific
 * streaming RPC.
 *
 * ## Starting and Stopping
 *
 * Streaming RPCs are stateful and need to be `start`ed before messages can
 * be sent and received. The PersistentStream will call the onOpen function
 * of the listener once the stream is ready to accept requests.
 *
 * Should a `start` fail, PersistentStream will call the registered
 * onClose with a FirestoreError indicating what went wrong.
 *
 * A PersistentStream can be started and stopped repeatedly.
 *
 * Generic types:
 *  SendType: The type of the outgoing message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ReceiveType: The type of the incoming message of the underlying
 *    connection stream
 *  ListenerType: The type of the listener that will be used for callbacks
